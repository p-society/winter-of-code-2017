# Winter Of Code 2017

The programming society of IIIT-Bh presents Winter of Code. An opportunity for those who want to get started with contributing to open source softwares but don't know how to. We know how frustrating and intimidating it can be, we've all been there and this is why we have decided to give you a chance to wet your feet in this vast ocean of **open source** and get you ready for a deep dive (maybe GSoC).

## How does this work?

During this winter you will work on open sourced projects created/maintained by your seniors and also on projects created/maintained by open source software organizations. You will keep a record of all the contributions you have made to different as a gists containing the links to all the PRs merged and issues raised and you will submit that list to us at the end of the competition folowing which the winners will be announced.

## But I know nothing about open source or software development. How do I get started?

Well we are preparing a list of resources(tutorials, articles, etc) that you can refer to when you have to learn something new or when you get stuck. It can be found [here](https://github.com/p-society/TheDevGuide). You should also go through this [guide](https://github.com/p-society/intro-to-open-source-2017) before making a PR.
